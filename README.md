# System Information Application

I have created this application to try out electron.

# Electron: https://electronjs.org/

You must have Node.js which you can find here: https://nodejs.org/en/

# To install run: 
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

# Or download the binary and unzip it to your computer and run "sysinfoapp.exe"
